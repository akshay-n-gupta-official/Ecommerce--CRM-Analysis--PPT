# Ecommerce--CRM-Analysis:

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) analysis involves the systematic examination and interpretation of data related to interactions between a business and its customers. 
Through CRM analysis, companies evaluate customer behavior, preferences, and feedback to gain valuable insights into their needs and expectations.

Within the context of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) analytics, prioritize customer-centric feature engineering. 

This includes creating metrics like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, offering insights into customer transaction patterns.

- Extend the analysis to incorporate unique product purchase details, derive RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores for customer segmentation, and categorize them based on activity levels.

- Integrate additional customer-centric features such as average days between purchases, preferred shopping days, and peak shopping hours for a holistic understanding.

The potential of this case study lies in its capacity to unveil valuable insights into customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
